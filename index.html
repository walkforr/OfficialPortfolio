            <h2> Walker Forrester</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my Profile. I am a current student in a coding bootcamp here at Georgia Tech right
                now gaining the skills to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. I've worked with many different
                technologies and frameworks such as Jquery, Axios, Express, MySQL, Node, have experience working with
                API's and making ajax requests inside and outside of Node. I use flexbox when styling my html pages. I
                find it fun and easy to manage. I'm still finding little css tricks along the way but that's one of my
                go-tos.</p>
            <p>
                Getting into coding really was the right move for me. I've always been infatuated with technology and
                how it makes our world turn. For me, the first time I truly fell in love with any type of technology
                was when I was very young and I saw my dad was playing the first Playstation. I can't describe how
                majestic it was to see someone press the 'OPEN' button, insert a CD, then see a game with beatiful
                colors like Crash Bandicoot or Final Fantasy VIII pop up on the screen and you be able to give the game
                commands via the controller. Ever since then I've had a dream of making a game or a program "one day"
                but it seemed out of reach becuase I was never exposed to the tech world nor did I know where to begin.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my teens I grew a passion for music and taught myself how to engineer songs and produce beats.
                Being an audio engineer and producer, you spend a LOT of time glued to your computer screen but it's
                what you love so it doesn't feel like "work" even though there are MANY frustrating problems that
                arise.
                This is what made me realize I wanted to get back to the dream I had as a kid, making programs.
                The process of coding is similar to that of the music production process for me. I like analyzing
                what's about to be made, coming up with a blueprint for how it's going to be made and then fulfilling
                the creative journey that it takes to be made.
            </p>

            <p>
                In January(2018) I met a network engineer/database manager who worked for HomeDepot and opened the door
                for
                me to start learning code.
                He got me started with learning SQL but I soon found out that you couldn't create applications with
                just SQL so I found myself learning Swift becuase I wanted to make iOS apps.
                I've had some experience working a little bit with the Swift language
                this year. I'm trying to build an app right now that will allow employees to log in, clock-in,
                clock-out, complete tasks, and post company wide "to-do's" as if there was a company white board on
                everyone's phone they could just look at that and know what the agenda is for the day. I'm also
                learning react.js which will allow me to create apps on
                both iOS and Android devices. I will say that I'm not an absolute pro yet at mobile application
                development, but I do have some knowledge and I'm putting in extra hours on the side of doing this
                bootcamp to become a pro in the near future. I have and am getting more experience right now with
                working with databases and making requests to a server. And after learning react.js fully, I'll be able
                to implement those skills fluently onto mobile app development. I'm also interested in Blockchain. I
                haven't fully grasped everything there is to know about it(which I'm not sure many have), but I
                have been reading up on it and I have this Chat App in the works that runs on Blockchain using
                Tendermint.js. I've heard that Blockchain will be a huge part of our future and I really would like to
                get in on this wave while it's early.
            </p>

                Aside from coding, I'm a pretty easy going person. Fall is my favorite season. It's calm and not too
                cold(usually). I love baseball and football. Playing those sports in highschool taught me how to work
                as a team and how to keep your cool when things aren't going your way. I spend lot of time with my
                family, mostly eating tons of good food made by both of my grandmothers. My dad's side being from south
                Georgia and my Mom's side being from Cuba, I get the best of both worlds at the dinner table.
